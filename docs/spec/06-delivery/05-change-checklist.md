## 0. GitHub Issue Intake

When the prompt includes a GitHub issue URL or an unambiguous issue number for
this repository, complete this gate before the request-start checklist:

- [ ] Issue title, body, labels, comments, and state were fetched.
- [ ] The reported problem was independently verified (reproduced or evidenced
  for a bug; confirmed missing or incomplete and in scope for a feature).
- [ ] Implementation started only after the problem was confirmed to exist.
- [ ] If the problem does not exist: the issue received a verification comment
  and was closed when the conclusion was clear, or left open when inconclusive.
- [ ] After a confirmed fix was merged: the issue received a resolution comment
  and was closed.
- [ ] The comment uses the issue's language.
- [ ] No unrelated issue was commented on or closed.
- [ ] Git push was not inferred from the issue link.

See [R5 — Verify linked GitHub issues](03-ai-development-workflow.md#r5--verify-linked-github-issues-before-work-then-reply-and-close).

## 0.1 GitHub Pull Request Intake

When the prompt includes a GitHub pull request URL or an unambiguous pull
request number for this repository, complete this gate before rewriting the
change or starting follow-up:

- [ ] Pull request title, body, files, commits, comments, checks, draft
  state, base/head, and linked issues were fetched.
- [ ] The **root-cause bar** was independently judged: real in-scope problem;
  the change actually removes that failure mode at the root; the diff is the
  smallest coherent fix; approach compatible with baseline, security, and
  architecture.
- [ ] Completeness gaps (specs, extra tests, i18n, e2e docs, style, naming)
  were not treated as merge blockers **unless** they are required to prove
  the root-cause fix.
- [ ] If the root-cause bar holds: the pull request was merged first,
  preserving the contributor's commits; landing blockers received only
  smallest-on-top commits.
- [ ] Follow-up started only after the pull request was in `main`, on local
  `main`.
- [ ] If the root-cause bar fails or a harm blocker exists: the pull
  request was not merged, was not approved as "direction is fine", and a
  comment recorded the evidence. The idea was not silently reimplemented.
- [ ] A draft pull request was not merged unless the user explicitly asked.
- [ ] The comment uses the pull request's language.
- [ ] No unrelated pull request was commented on or merged.
- [ ] The contributor's branch was not force-pushed. Unrelated remote
  publishing was not inferred from the pull request link.

See [R6 — Land a linked pull request only when it fixes the root cause with a minimal diff](03-ai-development-workflow.md#r6--land-a-linked-pull-request-only-when-it-fixes-the-root-cause-with-a-minimal-diff).

---

## 1. Request Start Checklist

Before editing any file for a new request:

- [ ] Existing uncommitted work — this session's and anyone else's — is
  identified and preserved.
- [ ] `origin/main` is fetched and local `main` is fast-forwarded (or unpushed
  local commits are integrated).
- [ ] No task branch and no worktree were created; work happens on local `main`
  in this checkout.
- [ ] The checkout's host toolchains, dependency tree, package stores, caches,
  and ignored local configuration are reused; no separate environment is
  installed for E2E.
- [ ] Staging will use explicit paths, and only paths this request touched will
  be committed.
- [ ] Delivery scope is recorded: a commit request stops at the local commit; a
  push request integrates latest `origin/main`, validates the final commit, and
  pushes `main`. Explicit narrower limits are honored.

---

## 2. Impact Analysis

Before starting implementation, answer these questions:

- [ ] What behavior changes does this change introduce?
- [ ] Which specs are affected? (list file paths)
- [ ] Does this change touch an architectural boundary? (process model, IPC, storage, security, plugin API)
- [ ] Does this change affect user-visible or protocol-visible behavior?
- [ ] Is local validation necessary for this change's risk and regression
  scope? If so, what is the smallest targeted check set?
- [ ] Which milestone deliverable does this relate to? (M1–M6, or none)

Reference the [spec update matrix](03-ai-development-workflow.md#3-spec-update-matrix) to determine required doc updates.

---

## 3. Spec Sync Checklist

After implementation (or alongside it):

- [ ] Every affected spec file is updated with the new behavior.
- [ ] If `AGENTS.md` changed: `CLAUDE.md` still mirrors the non-negotiables,
  both files share the same `Policy-Sync:` token, and `pnpm check:agent-policy`
  passes. The reverse applies when only `CLAUDE.md` changed.
- [ ] If architectural boundary changed: ADR is written or updated in `docs/adr/`.
- [ ] If an implementation default changed: `decisions-log.md` entry updated.
- [ ] If baseline frozen decisions are affected: baseline bump + explicit ADR (not MVP-normal).
- [ ] Cross-references between specs are still correct (no stale links).

---

## 4. E2E / Test Doc Checklist

- [ ] If user-visible or protocol-visible behavior changed: new or updated scenario in [04-e2e-test-plan.md](04-e2e-test-plan.md).
- [ ] If a scenario was added or updated, it follows the template (ID, title,
  preconditions, steps, expected, specs, acceptance, milestone, status).
- [ ] If a scenario was added or updated, the traceability matrix in §8 is current.
- [ ] Unit tests added or updated when the change's risk makes them necessary.
- [ ] Integration tests added or updated when an IPC/RPC contract change or
  cross-component regression risk makes them necessary.
- [ ] The smallest necessary targeted local checks passed, or local validation
  was assessed as unnecessary with no separate approval or waiver required.
- [ ] Relevant E2E suites were selected and passed on a candidate that contains
  latest `origin/main` before the request branch was pushed and a PR/MR was
  opened, or before a commit-only delivery was declared complete; required
  validation needs no separate user request. Documentation-only changes retain
  their existing exemption.
- [ ] Task-candidate E2E used the host development environment already
  provisioned in the primary checkout; no `pnpm install`/`npm install` or
  second dependency/runtime environment was created solely for E2E. Any
  missing/incompatible-host exception is recorded with its reason.
- [ ] Results apply to the commit the gate ran on, and the affected suites were
  rerun when the landed executable content changed. Any required suite not run
  is recorded with its reason, alternative validation, and remaining risk;
  delivery remains incomplete until that gate passes.
- [ ] Hosting-platform E2E jobs that start before the remote merge were observed
  and reported but do not replace the local `main` gate; a post-merge rerun
  happened when the landed executable content differs from the commit the gate
  ran on. Dispatch or rerun follows the hosting platform's or repository
  workflow's requirements.

---

## 5. Git Commit Checklist

- [ ] Change is one logical unit (or split into focused commits).
- [ ] No secrets, tokens, or local data in the diff.
- [ ] No `node_modules/`, build artifacts, or release packages in the diff.
- [ ] Commit message follows conventional format: `type(scope): description` (English only).
- [ ] Spec updates committed with code when tightly coupled, or adjacent `docs:` commit for pure docs.
- [ ] `git diff --stat` reviewed — nothing unexpected.

---

## 6. Pull/Merge Request Checklist

Before marking requested integration complete, apply the R4 delivery scope;
explicit branch-only or draft-only requests retain their narrower scope:

- [ ] Before the push, `origin/main` is integrated into the commit being pushed
  and the affected checks ran on that commit.
- [ ] For a code-bearing change: the relevant E2E gate ran against a candidate
  that contains latest `origin/main` before the branch push and PR/MR creation,
  or before a commit-only delivery was declared complete, or its `NOT RUN`
  limitation is recorded with reason, alternative validation, and remaining risk.
- [ ] Commit-only delivery did not publish remotely without separate
  authorization.
- [ ] For authorized delivery: the validated commit was pushed to `main`, and
  `git ls-remote --heads origin main` matches it.
- [ ] When `origin/main` moved between validation and the push, the affected
  suites were rerun on the final commit and recorded.
- [ ] No force-push, no rewriting of published history, no discarded unrelated
  work, no bypassed gate. Genuine blockers were reported.
- [ ] Local branches whose commits are already on `origin/main` were deleted.
- [ ] Issue reference is included when applicable (e.g. `Refs #12` or
  `Closes #12`).

---

## 6.1 Post-push Checklist

Run immediately after the push:

- [ ] The pushed commit is present on remote `main`
  (`git ls-remote --heads origin main` matches `git rev-parse HEAD`).
- [ ] `git status --short` shows only work that belongs to someone else — this
  request left nothing uncommitted behind.
- [ ] Local branches whose commits already reached `origin/main` are deleted;
  none of another session's branches or worktrees was touched.
- [ ] If launch was requested after delivery, the app was built and started from
  this `main` checkout and its development environment.

---

## 7. App version release checklist (stable tag)

Required for every stable app version bump / tag (D164). Skip only for
documentation-only work or non-release chores.

- [ ] `packages/shared/src/changelog.ts` has a newest-first entry for the
      release version under `en` and every shipped product locale (no leading
      `v`).
- [ ] Highlight counts match across locales; English is the source of truth.
- [ ] Bullets are short user-facing product notes (not raw PR/commit lists).
- [ ] Pre-release-only versions are omitted from the product catalog unless
      product explicitly ships in-app notes for that channel.
- [ ] `packages/shared/src/changelog.test.ts` lists the new version first.
- [ ] `pnpm --filter @pi-workspace/shared test` passes catalog alignment.
- [ ] `README.md` and `README.zh-CN.md` state the current
      `<major>.<minor>.x` release line and contain no toolchain, command,
      Highlights, or roadmap claim the release invalidates.
- [ ] `node scripts/check-release-docs.mjs` passes (version surfaces,
      shipped-locale catalog, README release line).
- [ ] Documentation commit is on the release branch **before**
      `node scripts/release.mjs <version> --tag` / `git tag v<version>`.
- [ ] GitHub auto-generated release body is treated as web-only, not the
      in-app source ([06-release-runbook.md §4.1](06-release-runbook.md#41-mandatory-release-version-surface-gate-d164--d260)).

## 8. Final Definition-of-Done Gate

Before marking work complete, verify **all applicable** conditions under the
user's delivery scope:

| # | Gate | Source |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Change implemented on local `main` that was up to date with `origin/main`; host environment reused | [R4 — Direct delivery on `main`](03-ai-development-workflow.md#r4--direct-delivery-on-main) |
| 2 | Code/doc implements the planned change | Step 4 of [development loop](03-ai-development-workflow.md#2-development-loop) |
| 3 | All impacted specs updated | [R1 — Spec-sync](03-ai-development-workflow.md#r1--spec-first--spec-sync) |
| 4 | E2E scenarios documented (or confirmed not needed) | [R3 — E2E coverage doc](03-ai-development-workflow.md#r3--e2e-coverage-doc) |
| 5 | Targeted local checks follow the existing risk standard; for a code-bearing change the relevant E2E gate passed on the commit that was pushed — a commit containing latest `origin/main` — or its `NOT RUN` limitation is recorded; the affected suites were rerun when `origin/main` moved before the push; required tests need no separate user request | Steps 7, 10, and 11 of development loop |
| 6 | Change committed with conventional message | [R2 — Commit-per-change](03-ai-development-workflow.md#r2--commit-per-change) |
| 7 | BOARD updated if milestone deliverable completed | Step 9 of development loop |
| 8 | No secrets or local data in commit | [§4.4 Never commit](03-ai-development-workflow.md#44-never-commit) |
| 9 | Authorized delivery completed: the validated commit is on `origin/main`, no task branch or worktree was created, stale local branches were deleted, and any requested launch uses this `main` checkout | [R4 — Direct delivery on `main`](03-ai-development-workflow.md#r4--direct-delivery-on-main) |
| 10 | `git ls-remote --heads origin main` matches the pushed commit and the checkout is clean of this request's leftovers | [§6.1 Post-push Checklist](#61-post-push-checklist) |
| 11 | If a GitHub issue was linked: verified before work; commented in the issue language; closed when conclusive | [R5 — Verify linked GitHub issues](03-ai-development-workflow.md#r5--verify-linked-github-issues-before-work-then-reply-and-close) |
| 12 | If a GitHub pull request was linked: root-cause bar reviewed; merged only when it actually fixes the problem with a minimal diff; follow-up after merge; contributor work not discarded for nits | [R6 — Land a linked pull request only when it fixes the root cause with a minimal diff](03-ai-development-workflow.md#r6--land-a-linked-pull-request-only-when-it-fixes-the-root-cause-with-a-minimal-diff) |

If any applicable gate fails, the requested integration is **not Done**; report
the blocker without weakening the gate.
